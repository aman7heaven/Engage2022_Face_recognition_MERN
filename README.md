# Advanced Face-Recognition System

The primary objective of our Time and Attendance Management System is to offer an efficient and effective Biometrics based time and attendance management system mainly through face recognition. Attendance project that will use webcam to recognize faces in real-time and record the attendance live in a dynamic table which is built using react. Face recognition systems are currently associated with many top technological companies and industries making the work of face recognition easier. The use of python programming and OpenCV makes it an easier and handy tool or system which can be made by anyone according to their requirement. The proposed system discussed in this project will be helpful for many as it is user friendly and cost-efficient system. Hence by the use of python and OpenCV the face recognition system can be designed for various purposes. This webapp is developed with the help of MERN STACK , OPENCV , FLASK , PYTHON.

3.Real-time Attendance Using Face Face_recognition

 This page has a seamless UI and the user has to show his/her face in order to get their attendance marked. They just have to simply show their faces and as soon as the name is displayed it means the face has been recognized and attendance is marked. Student or whomsoever wants to mark the attendance has to do nothing , it will take only a second to mark the attendance as they have to do nothing which in-short saves a huge amount of time and automates attendace taking system.

7.The real time attendace data is being sent to mongodb cloud database by using Pymongo and then that data is being fetched at the frontend using after user Authentication in the table using AXIOS of REACT.

8.User details protection

 The details of the user sent to backend are protected by JWT Authentication. The salts are also added for better protection(passwords are hashed). Here is the reference image of mongodb compass.
